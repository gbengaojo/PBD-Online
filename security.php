          <p><h4>Application Security</h4> Application Security revolves around your software and development teams. The objective is to integrate security into the software development process, and not after development, so that code is written with security in mind. Even with the best secure programming practices in place, threats still arise. Discovering and remediating vulnerabilities makes up the remainder of our Application Security practices.</p>

          <p><h4>Penetration Testing</h4> Penetration Testing evaluates the strength of your business’ security posture, in both software and hardware. Our pentesters actively attempt to breach your defenses, noting any incidences where they are able to do so, and providing recommendations for mitigation and remediation in a final report deliverable.</p>

          <p><h4>Threat Modeling</h4> Threat Modeling extends Penetration Testing by providing your business with visual diagrams of your information assets and personnel, correlated with perceived threats and associated risks. These can be used to further improve your overall security posture and make better informed decisions when determining where to allocate your resources.</p>

          <p><h4>Risk Assessment and Analysis</h4> We work with your management team to produce a comprehensive, high level overview of the risks that are posed to your organization, the potential impacts should a risk be realised, and roadmaps for the best course of action to help you secure your business.</p>

          <p><h4>Security Governance</h4> Knowing your security posture is crucial, but once you have this information, you need actionable procedures in order to implement your determined security policies. We provide consultations in these areas to help you get your security programs running smoothly.</p>
          <hr width="50%" style="text-align:center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 70px; margin-bottom: 70px;" />

          <p><h4>Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity</h4> Despite the best laid plans, security incidents can and do still occur.
